                    <p>Union County's landscape is dominated by mountains, forests, rivers, and wilderness areas that create unique HVAC requirements based on elevation, accessibility, property types ranging from traditional mountain homes to recreational cabins, and lifestyle patterns that include both permanent mountain residents and visitors enjoying the county's exceptional outdoor recreation and natural beauty throughout the Cumberland Plateau and Appalachian regions.</p>

                    <h3>Union County Mountain Climate and Wilderness Environment</h3>
                    <p>Union County's location in the Cumberland Plateau region with significant elevation changes, extensive forest coverage, and wilderness areas creates a mountain climate with cooler temperatures than surrounding lowland areas, higher precipitation, and more variable weather conditions that require heating and cooling systems capable of reliable operation in challenging mountain environments throughout diverse seasonal conditions.</p>

                    <p>Summer temperatures throughout Union County typically range from the 70s to mid-80s due to elevation effects, with humidity levels that can vary based on forest coverage and proximity to streams and rivers that flow through the county's mountainous terrain, creating conditions where efficient air conditioning and moisture control are beneficial for comfortable indoor environments during warm weather periods.</p>

                    <p>Winter temperatures in Union County often reach into the teens and 20s, with mountain areas receiving snow and ice that create demanding heating requirements for properties that must maintain comfortable living environments throughout extended cold periods.
